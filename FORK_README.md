**What Is This Fork In Here For?**

This fork is in the kstreet GitHub account because the fork is the copy that is referenced and currently used with:

- The `Street.MvxPlugins.PhoneNumbers` project needs a reference to the `libphonenumber-csharp` project 

**How Fresh Is This?**

- The code in this port was current/similar to the `libphonenumber-csharp`
 repo up through [this January 7, 2014 commit](https://github.com/erezak/libphonenumber-csharp/commit/7d26cea18bd9d5058aa9b22857bbfa5348077a6e).

Google provides [a nice online demo](http://libphonenumber.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/javascript/i18n/phonenumbers/demo-compiled.html) of what this library can do.

[Google's libphonenumber](http://code.google.com/p/libphonenumber/) is used inside of Android to format PhoneNumbers & get info and examples about them. Can be used for parsing, formatting, storing and validating international phone numbers.
